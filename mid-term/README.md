# Twitter Sentiment Classification (ML Zoomcamp Mid-term Project)
---------

## Problem Description

The Twitter Sentiment Classification project aims to build a robust model for determining the sentiment tone (positive or negative) of text data from Twitter. The goal is to create an accurate classifier that can understand the sentiment expressed in tweets, allowing for applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback processing, and social media monitoring.

## Context

In the age of social media, understanding public sentiment is crucial for businesses, researchers, and policymakers. This project addresses the need for an effective sentiment analysis tool specific to Twitter, one of the most influential social media platforms. By classifying tweets as positive or negative, we can gain insights into public opinion, brand perception, and societal trends.

## Dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project utilizes a labeled dataset **([train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/twitter-sentiment-analysis2/data?select=train.csv))** containing Twitter text and corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). Before building the model, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted. EDA involved:

- Data visualization to understand the distribution of positive and negative tweets.
- Text preprocessing to clean and prepare the text data for model training.

## Model Selection Process

The model selection process involves choosing a machine learning algorithm that best fits the sentiment classification task. Potential algorithms include:

- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The model selection process also includes:

- Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting parameters for optimal model performance.
- Cross-validation: Assessing model generalizability using k-fold cross-validation.
- Performance evaluation: Measuring model performance using Accuracy and F1-Score.

## Instructions for Dependencies and Virtual Environment Setup
